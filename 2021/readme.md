# AoC 2021

The famous [Kent Beck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent_Beck) software development methodology:

- Make it work
- Make it right
- Make it fast

Well, this year, AoC falls fairly far down in my list of priorities. As a result, I'm just doing the `make it work` part without any kind of post-activity cleanup, and sometimes relying on given aspects of the problem set rather than solving for a more general case. 

## Goals this year

I've timed myself on a lot of these just to see how long it takes for me to get to a working solution. I strived to complete both problems within 30 minutes, but my average is closer to an hour. I know there are people who can complete each of these in less than 10 minutes, which is very humbling. However, my only competition is my past self. My goals are self-improvement and over all FUN. If it's not fun, then what's the point?
